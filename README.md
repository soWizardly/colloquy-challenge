### Colloquy Challenge

Getting up & running should be just like any other laravel project -- 
but let me know if you need any help!

Just make sure you run 
`php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` 
as the UI is not fully featured & this app depends upon data generated from the seeder.

Once that's done, simply navigate to /register to setup an account and then follow
the links to the various meetings related pages from there.
